## Language Flags

Language flags and Country flags do **not** necessarily have the same abbreviation.
e.g.
  Farsi (Persian):  fa.png uses the Iranian flag (Country code **IR**).
  Georgian:         ka.png uses the Georgian flag (Country Code **GE**)

The language flags in this folder use the abbreviations from Yii's i18n system (see create_i18n.php usually in the "messages" folder for the full list).

Language flags have the first two characters in *lowercase* as per [ISO 639.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
e.g.
  Greek:    el.png
  English:  en.png

### Country Dialects

Country dialects are shown after a hyphen in *uppercase*.
e.g.
  British English: en-GB.png
  Chinese (China): zh-CN.png

## Country flags

Country flags have the first two characters in *uppercase* as per [ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes).
e.g.
  Greece: GR.png
